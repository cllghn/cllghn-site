# cllghn.me

My personal website, to play and tinker with. It was built [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and Tailwind. There is also a wee bit of D3; however, I will probably remove that in the future and switch over to Highcharts for accessibility purposes. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run-script dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
