            I currently serve as a Data Science Program Director at the Council of State Governments (CSG) Justice Center, where I lead the research efforts for Justice Counts. Previously, I founded and directed the Resident Corrections Analyst initiative, embedding data analysts in state correctional agencies to enhance data-driven strategies.
            <br />
            Before joining the CSG Justice Center, I was a faculty researcher for the U.S. Navy at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, CA. There, I supported homeland security and defense research through the lens of data science and taught courses on social networks analysis and data visualization to military, law enforcement, and international security professionals.
